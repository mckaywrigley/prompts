# Mckay's Prompts

This is a collection of prompts I use in my workflow.

I'll be updating this frequently, so check back often!

Latest update: 4/19/23

## Beta

I'm currently doing a beta test of this idea with some simple but useful prompts.

I'll improve it as feedback comes in.

Expect much more powerful prompts as I get this system ironed out.

## Usage

Download the json file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/142KoReNVMeoqcaZ3Njj9ltnadnEXAmCo/view?usp=sharing) and import it into [Chatbot UI](https://www.chatbotui.com/).

Or, you can just copy and paste the prompts you want into ChatGPT.

## Upcoming

I'll be back soon with a system for selecting the prompts you want to use so that you don't have to import them all at once.

I'm also building a system for everyone to create & share their own prompts.
